# Digital-Clock

This project implements a musical alarm clock using C language and Microchip Studio on an ATMega32 microcontroller. The project combines software development and hardware integration to create a functional alarm clock with musical alarm capabilities.

The alarm clock features a 16x2 LCD display for showing the current time and alarm time, along with a piezo buzzer that produces sound output. The user can set the alarm time using two push buttons and can turn the alarm on or off using a third push button. The clock's timekeeping functionality is achieved using an onboard real-time clock (RTC) module.

Key features of this project include:
• Clock display with real-time clock (RTC) functionality.
• Alarm feature with user-settable alarm time and on/off functionality.
• Musical alarm functionality that utilizes the piezo buzzer to produce a melody when the alarm is triggered.
• Use of the C language and Microchip Studio to implement the project on an ATMega32 microcontroller.

This project can serve as a starting point for developing other hardware projects with Microchip Studio and C language. It can also be used as an example of how to use Microchip Studio to integrate software and hardware components to create a functional device.
